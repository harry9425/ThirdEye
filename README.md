The key feature of Third Eye is the ability to track the location of another person with their consent. The app shares live location and finds the shortest path, as well as tracks and stores all the waypoints to the location. You can share your location with your loved ones, friends and family with a unique code that you provide to them. This feature can be especially useful for parents who want to keep track of their children's location, or for couples who want to stay connected when travelling.
